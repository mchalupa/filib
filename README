FiLib library
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This library aims to be lightweight booster for C programming language.
It implements some abstract datatypes as well as some usual functions
that can programmer need in day-to-day programming.

In this project I practice what I learn, so please don't be mad that I'm
reinventing wheel again. You don't have to use it :)
